# Arduino code of the project

- `ble_sensor` is the final code able to read the sensors and to send it through bluetooth
- `sensor_identifier` is a tool I used to map each pressure sensor to its two pins on the insole's connector
- `sensor_matrix` is a code to read all the value from a sensor matrix. It works in a different way than in `ble_sensor`
- `test_web_ble_array` is a code to send array of values through bluetooth
